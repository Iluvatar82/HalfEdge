<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Project aims to provide you with an easy-to-use (I am working on that one :)) Library to use in your Projects. The Feature-Set is kind of restricted at the moment, but that will change in the Future.

Benefits of using this Library:
* You can use this in a wide range of applications - to work with a mesh.
* I did it, so you won't have to write your own Library which does the same thing
* I try to keep the Code clean so everything can be used easily
* New features regarding the Mesh will follow soon:
  * Subdivision of the Mesh
  * Cutting of the Mesh with regards to a Plane (Axis-Aligned at the beginning, but general Planes will be supported in the Future)
  * Boolean Operations with multiple Meshes, like the Union and Difference

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

After including the Library in your Project, either via adding the Code directly to your solution or by adding a Reference to the DLL-File. You can start using the Library to do your computations.
Simple Conversions exist e.g. for the <a href="/Models/Base/Vertex.cs">Vertex</a> class to support an easy way to create your first <a href="/Models/Base/Mesh.cs">Mesh</a>.

### Installation

Download the Source-Code and add the Project to your Solution or get on the the generated DLLs and use this in your Project.
